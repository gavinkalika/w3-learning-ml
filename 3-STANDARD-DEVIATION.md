- Standard deviation (σ) is a number that describes how spread out the values are
- A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean or average value
- A higher standard deviation means the opposite. In other words, the values are more spread out.

# Variance
- variance is an alternative to standard deviation σ2
- fun fact if you take the square root of the variance you get the standard deviation
