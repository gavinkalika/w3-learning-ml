- ML is making the computer learn form studying data and statistics
- From a computer perspective a data set is any collection of data. This can be anything from an array to a complete database.
- For example, lets say we have an array like `[1, 1, 2, 3]` ... but examining this array we can determine the most common element is 1. This is a very simple example of what ML is for ... analyzing and predicting data.
- For ML we can split data into three main categories
    - Numerical
        - are data numbers that can be split into two sub categories discrete and infinite
    - Categorical
        - values that cannot be measure up against each other. For example, a dataset that has age, sec, race
    - Ordinal
        - similar to categorical, but can be measure against each other. For example, yelp reviews ... where the more stars indicating a favorable review

- * it is helpful to know what type of data you are dealing with. This way you will be able to know which technique to use to analyze them
